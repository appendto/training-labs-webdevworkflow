Web Developer's Toolbox Lab Project
----

This repository contains a base skeleton to be used during the "Web Developer's 
Toolbox" (or "Web Developer's Workflow") training class given by 
[appendTo](http://appendto.com).

## How to use this repository

The `master` branch of this repository holds the skeleton of a possible in-progress 
front end project. The various other branches include possible solutions for 
specific labs within the training course. Thus, if you were to simply look at the 
`lab-1-git-and-grunt` branch you would see how the training content lab was 
implemented in the instructor's solution.

There is also a `final-solution` branch which includes all completed lab content.

## Where to start

Most branches use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) for task running, even though that 
may not be the purpose of that particular lab. Thus you may want to tackle the 
"Setting up Grunt" lab first (the solution is in `lab-1-git-and-grunt`).

You can find all of the labs in the [LABS.md](LABS.md) file in this directory.
